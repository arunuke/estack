Configuring any node
======================
1. virtual machine 
2. ssh 
3. apache2 and nginx
4. libguestfs-tools
5. guestmount
6. qemu-kvm
7. libvirt-bin
8. virt-manager
9. chromium-broswer
10. ssh keys

1. Configure wget to use proxy


Configuring Ansible
=====================
1. Install latest ansible by including the Ubuntu PPAs, updating and then
installing ansible



Configuring Cobbler
====================

1. Install cobbler cobbler-common koan 

Ensure cobbler 2.4 is not installed. Many issues. To install 2.6.5-1, use 
http://springerpe.github.io/tech/2014/09/09/Installing-Cobbler-2.6.5-on-Ubuntu-14.04-LTS.html

2. Install apache2 apache2-docs apache2-utils
3. Install isc-dhcp-server
4. cobbler check
5. cobbler sync

Configuring Vagrant
====================
1. Install vagrant. Download the latest package from the vagrant downloads page (latest)
and not the stock debian version which is typically older.
2. Setup http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables before trying to install any plugin
3. Install vagrant-libvirt and vagrant-proxyconf plugins

Apache troubleshooting
======================

Cobbler troubleshooting
========================

1. Ran into the "httpd not found error". Root cause was that the IPs in 
/etc/cobbler/settings were incorrect. next_server and server need to be
set to IPs on the localhost.

Configuring SSH Gateway
========================

ssh -L <port on local host>:<target server>:<port on target server> <username@remotehost>


eg: ssh -L 10010:10.206.1.16:80 arunt@16.79.29.6

allows me to access the web browser (80) on 10.201.1.16 from my localhost (laptop)using
localhost:10010 via tunneling it through 16.79.29.6.

In essence, I am asking a local port forward from 10010 to port 80 on 10.206.1.16
via the intermediate nfvbits server at 16.79.29.6

Configuring virt-manager
=========================
virt-manager is not, for some reason, available from the default ubuntu repos. 

- Get keys for getdeb.net and add to current system
- add getdeb repo to apt sources.list
- do an apt-get update and pull the packages

http://linuxg.net/how-to-install-virt-manager-1-0-1-on-ubuntu-14-04-linux-mint-17-elementary-os-0-3-deepin-2014-and-other-ubuntu-14-04-derivatives/

Configuring webvirtmgr
========================
On server hosting webvirtmgr do
- install packages
- Setup supervisor, forget nginx, use ssh tunneling to access the web page 

On all client servers do
- https://www.webvirtmgr.net/docs/

Configuring git
================

When doing clone, use https instead of git since firewalls might not allow non https ports

Use --proxy=<http proxy> for all pip installs



ssh troubleshooting
====================

/var/log/auth.log for sshd logs
After virt-sysprep

Configuring Ruby
=================

1. Use gem install with the -p option specifying the https proxy. Thisaddresses the 
"not in gzip format" error.

2. If require mkmf error is encountered, install the ruby-dev package for the ruby
installation in question. Add zlib1g-dev for zlib missing errors
