security keys testing

1. opying the same public and private keys from one host to another and checking
whether i can login to a third host.

 -- A can login to B since it has it's public keys in B's authorized_keys (with 
    user and hostname of A)

 -- Copy As private and public keys as-is to C

 -- Try logging in to B from C


It works. In essence, I could use one set of public/private keys and push it to every
host and use it as key to login
