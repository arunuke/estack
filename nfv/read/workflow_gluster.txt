0. clear all VMs

[better do it separate. issues being observed when done back to back]

1. configure all the controller hosts

create-multi-nic-vhosts.yaml

// same procedure for NFV Control nodes running OpenSAF

2. configure all the gluster hosts

create-multi-disk-vhosts.yaml

// same for CEPH and VSA nodes

[optional : clear known_hosts on build and remote node, 
ssh into each machine to see if they are fine ]

run verify-connectivity.bash
run setup-ssh-known-host.bash

3. run python2.7 install script against all nodes
run setup-for-ansible.bash

4. configure the gluster backends

configure-gluster-nodes.yaml

5. configure the gluster server

configure-gluster-server.yaml
note: use host based extensions (like groups.gluster_node[0] for gluster-2 etc.

--Now gluster is up and running and ready to be mounted on the hosts

6. configure the gluster clients

configure-gluster-clients.yaml

--gluster volumes are still not mounted on 
run verify-shared-storage.bash
note : add this as a play, echo $hostname to hostname.txt file in shared storage

7. configure the controllers to move the data to shaerd storage and start the VMs

configure-nested-vhosts.yaml

- Now VMs are being started

8. now configure shared VMs
