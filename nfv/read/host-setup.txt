Setting up a host in the FTC lab, SL cluster

- Get on a gateway jump server through RDP.

  jumpserver 16.79.29.136
  Username: nfvrdp\arunt
  Password: HP1nvent

- Go to https://rndwiki.corp.hpecorp.net/confluence/display/NFV/OpenSAF+SL to find out iLO information

- if iLO uses DHCP, use "host <ilo hostname> from jump server to get iLO IP address

- ensure the system has legacy SATA support enabled to install Ubunty 16.04 and above.
  Go to BIOS mode (F9), choose "System Options", then "SATA Controller Options", then 
  "Embedded SATA Configuration" and choose the legacy driver "Enable SATA Legacy Support".

- When the system is booting, choose eno1, or the embedded NIC as the primary. That is connected to
  corp network

- Choose manual IP address, pick one from the IP range provided on the wiki page
  netmask : 255.254.0.0
  gateway : 10.207.0.1

- Don't use up all the disk available for the install. Pick 50% capacity in case you have to use it later

- Install the ssh and virtual machine packages


After the system installed, perform

- uname -r
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-cache search linux-image- (for the latest kernel, also get equivalent cloud-tools, headers, tools) 
- sudo apt-get install <latest kernel and extra>
- reboot machine and it will come back up with the latest kernel



on each host, remove sudo password requiremetn for arunt

run ssh-keygen to create a key, use it for all cloud init files
