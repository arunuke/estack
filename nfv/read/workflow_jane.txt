0. clear all VMs

cleanup-vms.yaml 
//clears all multi nic and multi disk VMs on a remote host

1. configure all the controller hosts

create-multi-nic-vhosts.yaml
// same procedure for NFV Control nodes running OpenSAF

2. configure all the gluster hosts

create-multi-disk-vhosts.yaml
// same for CEPH and VSA nodes

3. check if "neo", the seed node is visible. neo connects to all
nodes and neo is the onlyone with a macvtap interface. To create
all interfaces with macvtap, modify the plays.

Only reason to do this with no macvtap is to save IPs on the
10.206 net.

run verify-connectivity-seed.bash
run setup-ssh-known-host-seed.bash

4. run python2.7 install script against all nodes
run setup-for-ansible.bash

5. setup seed node by copying ssh profiles, changng permissions, installing
ansible and setting up git

4. configure the gluster backends

configure-gluster-nodes.yaml

5. configure the gluster server

configure-gluster-server.yaml
note: use host based extensions (like groups.gluster_node[0] for gluster-2 etc.

--Now gluster is up and running and ready to be mounted on the hosts

6. configure the gluster clients

configure-gluster-clients.yaml

--gluster volumes are still not mounted on 
run verify-shared-storage.bash
note : add this as a play, echo $hostname to hostname.txt file in shared storage

7. configure the controllers to move the data to shaerd storage and start the VMs

configure-nested-vhosts.yaml

- Now VMs are being started

8. now configure shared VMs


9. TODO: OVS

10. Configure a hosted VM
